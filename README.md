# Current release: netatalk-classic-20200923

netatalk-classic is an implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite for Linux
and NetBSD.

netatalk-classic was forked from the last release of Netatalk that supported
AppleTalk (2.2.6).

netatalk-classic is maintained by Christopher Kobayashi <software+github@disavowed.jp>

## Why?

The Netatalk-3.x branch doesn't support classic Macintosh networking.  Netatalk-2.2.6 had TCP/IP support roughly welded in, creating an unreasonable amount of code complexity and the associated code maintenance nightmare thereby.

netatalk-classic is an attempt at creating a codebase that effectively and securely fulfils a single purpose: file/printer sharing with classic Macintoshes (Macinti?  I'm unsure about the plural here)

## How?

* Execute ./bootstrap in the top directory.  You'll need automake, autoconf, and libtool (at least) on top of a working toolchain.

* ./configure [options].  NetBSD users will probably want "--prefix=/usr/pkg".

* make; make install.

* For now, use whichever init files your distribution uses for netatalk-2.2.x.  In the near future, working systemd unit files will be installed if the build framework detects /usr/lib/systemd/system

## Coming soon?

* sqlite backend for CNID.

* Less crufty .ini configuration parsing.

* Transparent handling of BinHex/MacBinary formats.

## News for 20210128:

* DSI support (and thus AFP3.x) has been completely removed from afpd.  The possible attack surface is much, much smaller now.

* Code that was orphaned by DSI/obsolete platform removal has been removed.  The codebase is much easier to understand now.

* cppcheck revealed a number of unsafe bitwise arithmetic.  Unambiguous types have been used where appropriate.

* afprun() (i.e., "the pass-random-things-to-a-root-shell routine") has been taken out back and shot.

* Kerberos support removed.

* CNID now only supports BerkeleyDB and "last" backends.

* Miscellaneous platform/portability fixes from @rdmark and Florian Kolb

## News for 20200923:

* Ubuntu ships an older version of gcc that is much more paranoid than the version shipped with NetBSD and ArchLinux, so it flagged many cases of system call return values being ignored.  That might not be a problem for chown() and chdir(), but we definitely want to know when seteuid() and siblings are having problems.  Warnings are now logged when system calls fail.

* The logging routine now adds a local timestamp and respects the loglevel setting.

## News for 20200921:

* Support for obsolete platforms and non-AppleTalk functions were removed to keep the codebase manageable (and reduce the potential attack surface).  If you need to serve AppleTalk on TRU64, Solaris, Irix, and so forth, please use Netatalk 2.2.6.  If you need TCP/IP support, please use Netatalk 3.x.

* Many superfluous functions have been removed.  These include authentication modules that are not supported by AppleTalk Client 3.7.4 and earlier, filesystem quota support, and so forth.

* Daemons log unilaterally to /var/log/netatalk/${DAEMON}.log, and ignore loglevel.  Loglevels will be restored when I consider this codebase to be bulletproof.

* Obsolete CNID database backends have been disabled.  DBD and "last" are the only backends supported.

* All compiler warnings have been dealt with.  The codebase compiles with -Wall -Werror (which is now the default compilation setting).  There are a few erroneous warnings which have been mitigated.

* The default AFP umask is now 022 instead of 000.
